Microservices
=============

# Spring Cloud

Spring cloud provides tools for developers to quickly build some of the common pattern in distributed systems e.g configuration management, service discovery, circuit breakers, 
intelligent routing, microproxy, control bus, one-time tokens, global locks, leadership election, distributed sessions, cluster state).

Principles advantage of microservices is apply new technology and Proccess Adaptation, dynamic scaling and Faster releases cycles.

Now, I work with spring boot version 2.1.14
